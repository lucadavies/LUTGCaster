# Thanks for stopping by! I hope you find this useful :)

#### IMPORTANT: This is a WINDOWS application. it will not run on MacOS. Annoyingly, it will also not run on university computers (you must be an administrator on the computer). You must run it from your own computer. Windows will shout at you that the application is from an "unknown publisher" (that's me). Click "Run Anyway" to continue (you may need to click "More Info" before the "Run Anyway" button is shown).

TL;DR - you must run this on a personal Windows computer.

#### The built program for Windows can be downloaded from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZL_mW-Gjg0B-NCBInUW9AXlddgTK168F/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. (29/04/2021)

## Usage

To set up a new casting sheet:

1. Click "Add Show", enter the title of the show and names of the characters/roles available (clicking the "Add Role" button as needed). Repeat for each show.
1. Select the maximum number of actors that may be candidate for any given role with the number selector.
1. Click "Generate Casting Sheet".
1. Then click "Save Sheet" on the Casting Sheet screen to ensure you work isn't lost!!

Using the Casting Sheet:

1. Enter all actors into the appropriate boxes beneath each role for each show
1. Save sheet when done
1. Names will be coloured automatically as you enter them. The colours always update to reflect to the state of a name.
1. The zoom buttons may be used to crudely scale the interface for better viewing on a projector.
1. The "About..." link will bring up a window to explain the meaning of colours and information about the application.
1. When a role has been cast, remove the 2nd-6th choices and click "Cast" to hide the other boxes.

Some notes:
* Various autosaves are used: in the folder where the program is run from, the Backup folder holds a copy of a casting sheet when first opened/created. Until first saved by the user, the temp folder holds a temporary working copy of the casting sheet. In use, casting sheets are auto saved on every name change / Casting / RONing.
* When clicking "Cast", make sure all names have been removed from the lower down choices or else the hidden names will still contribute towards the colour of those names elsewhere. This is to prevent accidental clicks of the Cast button deleting other choices and causing confusion.
* If a name appears the wrong colour, check it doesn't have any extra spaces (or other whitespace characters) at the end. I plan to fix this at next update (if I get around to it)

Bugs:
* Spam double-clicking a textbox or the highlight button can cause the flashing textboxes to finish the wrong colour. Save > close > reopen to remedy.

Enjoy! :)
