# Thanks for stopping by! I hope you find this useful :)

To set up a new casting sheet:

1. Click "Add Show", enter the title of the show and names of the characters/roles available (clicking the "Add Role" button as needed). Repeat for each show.
1. Select the maximum number of actors that may be candidate for any given role with the number selector
1. Click "Generate Casting Sheet"
1. Then click "Save Sheet" on the Casting Sheet screen to ensure you work isn't lost!!

Using the Casting Sheet:

1. Enter all actors into the appropriate boxes beneath each role for each show
1. Save sheet when done
1. All names will remain white until the "Toggle Checking" button is clicked to enable active colouring of names.
1. The zoom buttons may be used to crudely scale the interface for better viewing on a projector
1. The "About..." link will bring up a window to explain the meaning of colours and information about the application.
1. When a role has been cast, remove the 2nd-6th choices and click "Cast" to hide the other boxes

Some notes:
* If the zoom buttons are greyed out, maximise the window again and click the actual "Minimise" button (as opposed to dragging the title bar fromthe top of the screen), this is a known bug.
* When clicking "Cast", make sure all names have been removed from the lower down choices or else the hidden names will still contribute towards the colour of those names elsewhere. This is to prevent accidental clicks of the Cast button deleting other choices and causing confusion.
* If a name appears the wrong colour, check it doesn't have any extra spaces (or other whitespace characters) at the end. I plan to fix this at next update (if I get around to it)

Enjoy! :)
